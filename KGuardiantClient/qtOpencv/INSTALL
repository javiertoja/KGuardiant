Copy file to your project's source tree is enough. ^_^

## Build examples

Before compile the examples or unit tests, you must make sure that OpenCV 2.2 or newer has been installed in your computer.

If the OpenCV has been installed to standard location, nothing special needed to do. Otherwise, you can to set environment variable or qmake's persistent property or ... 

For example, setting qmake's persistent property is very easy. 

```
   qmake -set OPENCV_VERSION 2.4.3
   qmake -set OPENCV_INCPATH D:/opencv/build/include
   qmake -set OPENCV_LIBPATH D:/opencv/build/x86/vc10/lib
```

More information can be found in README.md file.
